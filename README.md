![Project Preview](https://github.com/thisissophiawang/Grass-vs-Wood-Texture-Detection/blob/main/texture-classification-preview.svg)

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements **two texture classification algorithms** to distinguish between **grass** and **wood** images. The goal is to explore different **texture feature extraction techniques** and evaluate their effectiveness in a machine learning-based classification system.  

### **Objective**  
- Implement and compare **two texture analysis techniques**:  
  - **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**  
  - **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**  
- Train and evaluate **machine learning classifiers** (e.g., SVM, k-NN, Decision Trees).  
- Develop an **interactive interface** using **Gradio** for real-time texture classification.  
- Analyze the **performance, strengths, and weaknesses** of each approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction Techniques**  
#### **Technique 1: GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**
- Computes **texture properties** such as:  
  - Contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity  
- Extracts **statistical features** at different angles and distances.  

#### **Technique 2: LBP (Local Binary Patterns)**
- Converts images into **binary patterns** based on local pixel intensity.  
- Generates **LBP histograms** for feature representation.  
- Tested with **different radii and neighbor configurations**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Vector Compilation**
- Each extracted feature is converted into a **numerical vector**.
- Feature vectors are labeled as **"Grass"** or **"Wood"**.
- Stored for **classifier training and evaluation**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Models**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**  
- **Decision Trees**  
- Models trained on both **GLCM and LBP** feature sets.
